# WaterplEase

WaterplEase is a Python Project created by group L1-f-4

## Installation

Install requests for the project to function properly:

```bash
pip install requests
```

## Running files

To run the files, you must have them all downloaded since they import functions from each other. The files were set up with function calls to run everything inside the file by itself so when the file (specifically gui.py) is run, it will read the data, compare values, and display all information to the user in a GUI format.
